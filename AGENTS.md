## Project Identity

This repository is a Trading Operating System for observing, verifying, monitoring, and controlling an automated US equity trading engine.

It is not a retail brokerage UI, stock recommendation app, or chart-first app.

## Mandatory Operating Rules

1. Do not start work without a task id.
2. Do not scan the whole repository by default.
3. Read generated context bundles first when they exist.
4. Follow `ops/task_profiles.yaml`.
5. Respect `ops/doc_registry.yaml`.
6. Never treat archived/superseded docs as active SSOT.
7. Do not create new markdown reports outside the relevant task report folder.
8. All task outputs must update `ops/task_registry.yaml`.
9. All new docs must update `ops/doc_registry.yaml`.
10. Run required validators before closeout.

## Trading Safety

- No real capital.
- No live order.
- No broker mutation.
- No paper promotion unless explicitly accepted.
- Missing or stale data is UNKNOWN/BLOCKER, not negative evidence.

## UI Safety

- No one-off components.
- No business logic in UI.
- No IA redesign without approval.
- Storybook before P0 screens.
- Screenshot/Vision QA required for UI screens.

## Completion Definition

A task is complete only when:

- task registry updated
- doc registry updated
- required validators pass
- artifact manifest exists
- no forbidden files touched
- closeout report exists
